# Welcome to my teaching page!

Thus far in my academic career I have TA'd three courses:
* General Relativity w/ Prof. Rachel Rosen at Columbia University;
* Quantum Field Theory w/ Prof. Sergei Gukov at Caltech;
* Complex Analysis w/ Prof. Hiroshi Oguri at Caltech.

I have a number of recitation notes from these courses. I plan on uploading them here soon.
