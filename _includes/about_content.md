# Welcome to my about page!

I'm a [NASA Einstein Fellow](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program) at Cornell University
studying the nature of gravity within our Universe.
I'm also a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://ligo.org), the [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org/), and the [SXS Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org).


I received my BS in Physics and Mathematics from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu) in 2019 and received my PhD in Physics from the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu) in 2024, for which I was awarded the [Robert F. Christy Prize](https://www.pma.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/physics/physics-prizes-awards/robert-f-christy-prize-winners) for "an outstanding doctoral thesis in theoretical physics" and elected to present one of the [2024 Everhart Lectures](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/graduate-students-present-everhart-lectures-on-gravitational-memory-and-genome-defense) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Fe3voDxnM)). In 2024, I was selected to be an Einstein Fellow at Cornell University as a part of the [NASA Hubble Fellowship Program](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program). In addition, I simultaneously hold visiting appointments at the Flatiron Institute's [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) and Princeton University's [Center for Theoretical Sciences](https://pcts.princeton.edu) and [Gravity Initiative](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=princeton+gravity+inititative&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).


Outside of physics, I am an avid backpacker/hiker and a novice whittler.
