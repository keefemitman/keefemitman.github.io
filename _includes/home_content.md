# Welcome to my website!

I'm a NASA Einstein Fellow at Cornell University
studying the nature of gravity within our Universe.
One of the big questions of modern physics is whether
Einstein's equations wholly describe gravity, or if they
need to be modified to explain phenomena like
quantum gravity, dark energy, and/or dark matter.
Perhaps one of our best chances for understanding this
(among other things like astrophysics and cosmology)
is through the gravitational waves that are emitted by
binary black hole coalescences, i.e., comparing what
Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts with
what we observe in gravitational wave observatories
like LIGO.


But it turns out that solving Einstein's equations for
the problem of merging black holes is *very* difficult.
And to do so, we need the help of supercomputers and
the field of *numerical relativity*. 


With the [Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org) I run these simulations and
build models of the gravitational waves that are emitted by
black hole coalescences, to help aid with this project
of putting Einstein's equations to the test!


While there's too much that intrigues me to describe here,
this summarizes my main research interest. But for even more details,
